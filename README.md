While the exact steps can vary depending on your environment, here's a general guide to set up a PHP project:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the Loan System repository to your local machine using Git.

2. **Install a local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)**: To run a PHP application, you need to have a local server setup. Download and install a software that can provide this, like XAMPP or WAMP.

3. **Move the project to the server's root directory**: Once the server is set up, move the cloned project to the root directory of your server. This is typically the 'htdocs'
